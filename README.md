Lab 1 - 'Regression'.Implementation and utilization of linear regression analysis to establish a relationship between a vehicle's weight and its petrol consumption.


Lab 2 - 'Genetic algorithm'.Implemenetation of a genetic algorithm to find the optimal solution to the knapsack problem. By simulating the process of natural selection, the algorithm iteratively improves the solution set to maximize the total value of items packed in the knapsack without exceeding its capacity.
